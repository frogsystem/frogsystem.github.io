{"name":"Frogsystem 2","tagline":"Welcome to the project page of Frogsystem 2. The last release was v2.0.0-alix7 and the current development branch is alix8.","body":"\r\n### About the project\r\nThe Frogsystem 2 aims to be a full fledged CMS specialized for community fan pages.\r\nIt dates back to the early 2000er years when it was written as CMS for the famous [World of Gothic](http://www.worldofgothic.de) community. After a maintainer change in 2007, it was released as open source and leveled up to its second incarnation. Thus, the code base is very old and crappy.\r\n \r\n### Releases\r\nThe latest release is [v2.0.0-alix7](https://github.com/mrgrain/Frogsystem-2/wiki/Release-2.alix7) from **10/02/2015**.
